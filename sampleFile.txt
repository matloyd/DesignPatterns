Create the TitleLabel
I add a TitleLabel object to every client and server window. Windows are not
required to have a TitleLabel; I just like how it displays the name of the
game. You may choose to not add TitleLabel objects to your client and server
windows.
The programs in this book use the same TitleLabel class that was created in
one of the projects in the More Do-It-Yourself Java Games book. If you have
that class, you may skip the rest of this setup and go to the first project:
“Project 1 - Hit Counter.”
To create the TitleLabel class, do the steps in this list.
1. Create a new Java project named My Components. (Hint: to create a
project in Eclipse, right click in the Project Explorer and choose
New/Java Project. Hint: the minimum JRE required for the programs in
this book is Java SE 1.8. When you create the project, select a JRE
execution environment of Java SE 1.8 or higher.)
2. Create a new package named
___________._____________.mycomponents in the project. (Hint: to
create a package in Eclipse, right click on the project and choose
New/Package. Fill in the blanks with a unique package name. As
explained in the first book, the package name should be unique to you,
all lowercase, contain no spaces, and its components separated by
periods. Most businesses use their company name. You could use your
first and last name. I'll use annette.godtland throughout these examples.)
3. In the mycomponents package, create a new class named TitleLabel,
which uses JLabel as its superclass and has no method stub code. (Hint:
to create a class in Eclipse, right-click on the package and choose
New/Class. The only modifier needed is public. Hint: to easily enter the
superclass, click Browse..., start typing the name of the superclass, then
select the superclass from the list. Hint: when not specified as right-
click, “click” means to click on the object using the left mouse button.)
